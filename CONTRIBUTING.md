Thanks for your interest in contributing!

### Getting started

- Node >= 18.18
- Install deps: `npm i`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`

### Development

- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`

### Release process

- We use Changesets. Merging to `main` opens a version PR.
- Merging the version PR publishes to npm with provenance.

### Commit style

- Conventional Commits preferred (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).

### Code style

- ESM only. No default exports.
- Prefer small, well-named functions.
